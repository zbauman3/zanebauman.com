## About

This project started as a simple idea: I wanted a small display on my desk that could show bits of information throughout the day. There are already a ton of these informational displays on the market, but if I’m being honest, actually having the display was never as interesting to me as building it. I’d always wondered how LED matrix displays worked, and combining one with networking sounded like a great excuse to also explore IoT development.

Thus "Illumindex" was born, short for "Illuminated Information Index" (yes, the second "i" stands for information, not index). It is not a great name, but I am terrible at naming things, and that is not really the point of this project anyway.

The hardware for this project is incredibly minimal, so this post will focus mostly on the software. I will be diving very deep into many different aspects of the code, and hopefully you will learn something interesting along the way. At the very least, each section begins with a high-level overview, so even skimming the article should be somewhat interesting.

### Architectural Overview

Since this was my first exploration into the world of IoT, I wanted to focus heavily on the embedded side of the project. Specifically, I wanted hands-on experience writing a decently robust network stack for the firmware. This included everything from establishing a WiFi connection, handling reconnections, and syncing with NTP servers, to wrapping low-level HTTP requests with a higher-level "fetch" abstraction for working with JSON REST endpoints. Luckily, ESP-IDF provides a vast library of APIs that handle most of the extremely low-level networking details (alas, I did not write my own TCP/IP stack).

Outside of the network stack, I also wanted to build the display driver and a small set of utilities for working with bitmap graphics, including custom ASCII fonts, simple shapes, and graphs. But I didn’t want to base these on code I had seen elsewhere or simply copy other solutions. I wanted to genuinely learn the challenges of these systems and write the implementations according to my own understanding and capabilities.

That is not to say I avoided other libraries or articles. All of the code here is my own, but I gained a huge amount of insight and direction from open-source projects and technical articles, many of which were incredibly helpful in guiding me through difficult problems. I will discuss these sources in their relevant sections below.

For the cloud backend, I went with what I know well from work. The backend is written in TypeScript/Node.js and hosted on one of [Vercel’s hobby plans](https://vercel.com/pricing). For simplicity of maintenance, speed of execution, and cost, Vercel made the most sense to me. I initially planned to use Next.js as a quick way to deliver simple Node.js logic to [Lambda functions](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), but I eventually added some UI development utilities to the application that can also be accessed via the local development server.

### AI/LLM Involvement

It’s the end of 2025 at the time of writing. LLMs are everywhere and anyone in the tech industry is aware that they're nearly inescapable at this point. Endless discussions are being had about the future of software engineering and how LLMs fit into it – or maybe, how humans fit into it. I don’t believe this article is the place for me to brain dump my opinions. However, I will say that I am especially concerned with patterns we are beginning to see. More and more engineers use LLMs to achieve a goal, but then move on without taking time to learn from the problems that they have just solved.

I believe that growth in _engineering fundamentals_ is a journey that never ends, and outsourcing thought and understanding to LLMs will have deep, negative impacts on engineers in the long run. Less human involvement in software engineering may be the future, and that's okay. But for now, I _like_ software engineering and deeply value the growth that comes from understanding a problem and designing a solution.

This project was written without _any_ LLM "agent" involvement. It _was_ written with LLM autocomplete "suggestions". To me, this is the perfect symbiosis between LLMs and software engineering. It allows me to drive the line-by-line architecture of the system, encounter problems, explore solutions, choose the directions of the software, and maintain a deep understanding of the system, while at the same time speeding up development and reducing physical fatigue.

This article, however, has been significantly reviewed and edited by an LLM. I've written all initial versions, but I've also passed the output to an LLM for corrections and consistency.

## Software

This project was built entirely from scratch, using Espressif's [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.3.1/esp32s3) through their wonderful [ESP-IDF Extension for VSCode](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/vscode-esp-idf-extension/).

## Hardware

The hardware for this project is nothing special. The MCU is an ESP32-S3 development board, connected to a 64x64 RGB LED Matrix panel. It is powered with a 5V 4A switching power supply. I also added a switch to toggle the MCU's power source between the USB port and the power supply, since there are no protection diodes for the USB port on the development board I used.

### 3D Models

The body was printed with PETG. If I were to improve this design a little, I would have made it easier to plug in the USB cord without needing to disassemble the body.
